# Kubernetes basics

This repository contains the exercises used in the kubernetes course.
It has a folder for each exercise and the solution is available in a separate directory.

## Using a realworld kubernetes cluster 

Unfortunately microk8s cannot be installed on a docker container, so it is also not available through gitpod.
For this reason I manage a real kubernetes cluster, which is running on AWS, to be used for this session.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datamindedbe/kubernetes_academy_course)

Usage:
- run the following command in gitpod to get access to the cluster: `gp idp login aws --role-arn arn:aws:iam::299641483789:role/kubernetes-workshop-gitpod-role`
- run then: `./connect_cluster.sh k8s-24vTxK`

This works because the instructor has setup the connection between gitpod and the eks cluster as follows: https://www.gitpod.io/docs/integrations/aws

- Create a namespace for yourself and make sure to create *all resources in your own namespace* such that you do not impact each other.
```
kubectl create namespace <your-first-name>
kubens <select your namespace>
```

## Alternative: perform exercises locally

If you do not have a kubernetes cluster to run against, I can recommend microk8s to simulate a k8s cluster on your local machine.
More info on installing it can be found here: https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started
Some of the exercises work differently locally vs on a real cluster, this is mainly the case for the services, persistent volumes and ingress exercises.
